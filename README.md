Rhizome Project
===============

Rhizome is Mobile Health using AngularJS and HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). It stands for  *Resource-based Health Information Zone for the Mobile Enterprise*.

<!---In the philosophy of [Deleuze and Guattari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism_and_Schizophrenia), a *rhizome* is a non-hierarchical alternative to binary opposition, which describes a cultural discourse that provides multiple entry and exit points for interpretation; when a rhizome is divided, the sub-divisions are all fruitful.

Rhizome is a library of templates and services I am building using AngularJS and other JavaScript libraries, guided by the notion of creating a set of client-side components that support standards-based client-side mobile and social application development for the Healthcare industry.

This work is based on three technical requirements:

1. Create component demonstrators that are portable and easily shared using Github and jsFiddle.
2. Demonstrate use of AngularJS as an early adopter of features from the W3C [Web Components](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) specification, and as a mechanism for managing client-side services.
2. Demonstrate use of [HL7 FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/) as an early adopter of resource-based, mobile and social features in a health standard, as well as elements from the NIEM Health Domain.

<!---Like the rhizome, the HL7 FHIR standard is non-hierarchical, relying instead on multiple entry points and interdependencies through linking. This is a concept borrowed from [Roy Fielding's work on REST](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm). By sub-dividing a web application into services and components, Web Component frameworks like Mozilla [Brick](http://brick.mozilla.io/), Google [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Polymer](https://plus.google.com/+PolymerProject/posts) follow a similar guiding principle.-->
